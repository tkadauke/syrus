# Features

This page is the product-level reference. Use [Concepts](/docs/concepts)
for the data model and [Workflows](/docs/workflows) for execution chains.

## Jobs

A Job is the unit operators track in the UI. It represents one thread of
work from a GitHub issue, scheduled task, direct prompt, or chat proposal.

Jobs show the repository, source prompt, state, priority, credential mode,
agent provider, active Workflow, past Workflows, transcripts, captured
diffs, PR link, attachments, dependencies, and logs. Operators can retry,
cancel, run again, change priority, approve, or inspect the related PR.

Job kinds:

| Kind | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `issue` | A GitHub issue selected by trigger label or delegated from the repository issues panel. |
| `cron` | A scheduled task fire. |
| `direct` | An operator-created prompt with no GitHub issue. |

## Epics

Epics group related Jobs inside one repository. They are useful when a
goal is larger than one PR but still needs visible sequencing.

An Epic has a board state: `backlog`, `ready`, `in_progress`, `done`, or
`archived`. Child Jobs can be blocked until the Epic starts, and Epics can
depend on other Epics. Syrus can mark an Epic ready when its dependencies
are done and all child Jobs are confirmed, then mark it done when all child
Jobs close through merged PR outcomes.

Chats can propose Epics or propose an Epic with child Jobs. The operator
confirms the proposal before Syrus creates the real records.

## Schedules

Scheduled tasks attach a recurring or one-shot prompt to a repository.
When a task fires, Syrus creates a normal `cron` Job and runs the standard
issue-to-PR pipeline on a scheduled branch.

Supported schedule kinds:

| Kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `cron` | Five-field cron expression interpreted in UTC, limited to at most one fire per hour. |
| `one_shot` | A single future fire time. |

The `pr_pileup_policy` controls what happens if the last scheduled PR is
still open: `skip`, `pile`, or `replace`. Repeated failures can
auto-pause a task until an operator fixes and resumes it.

## Chats

Chats are operator conversations with repository context. A chat can
attach repositories, Jobs, documents, notes, and whiteboard state. The chat
agent can read selected repository context, propose Jobs, propose Epics,
schedule recurring work, inspect existing Jobs or PRs, and create proposal
cards for the operator to confirm.

Chats do not silently materialize work just because the assistant suggested
it. Proposal tools create cards; confirmation creates the real Job, Epic,
GitHub issue, or scheduled task.

## Direct Jobs

Direct Jobs are for work that should start from an operator prompt instead
of a GitHub issue. Choose a repository, title, priority, optional provider,
prompt, and attachments. Syrus creates a `direct` Job and runs the normal
Initial workflow.

Use direct Jobs for internal chores, private context, or experiments that
do not need a GitHub issue first. Use GitHub issues when the work should be
visible in the repository's ordinary planning flow.

## Credentials

Each user owns their own credentials and defaults:

- GitHub credential or linked GitHub App access.
- Claude credential.
- Codex credential.
- Default agent provider.
- Max-turn setting.
- Scheduling pause setting.
- Admin API token, for admins.

Credentials are stored with Active Record Encryption in the Syrus database,
so every web, worker, console, and migration context that reads users needs
`RAILS_MASTER_KEY`.

## GitHub App And PAT Behavior

Repositories prefer an active GitHub App installation when one is linked
for the repository owner. If no active installation is available, Syrus
falls back to the user's PAT. Jobs persist the selected `credential_mode`
as `app` or `pat` so operators can tell which credential path was used for
that run.

Clone remotes use anonymous GitHub URLs. Token-bearing push URLs are
constructed for the individual push command and are not written into
`.git/config`.

## Multi-User Model

Syrus works well as a single-user deployment for one operator's own
repositories, and it can grow into one deployment serving multiple users.
Users have their own repositories, credentials, provider defaults,
schedules, chats, Epics, Jobs, and admin/API permissions. Repository
settings can override the user's provider default when a codebase needs a
specific agent.

When more than one user exists, the app shows a team directory with each
member's role, profile link, and lightweight workload counts. Single-user
instances keep the primary navigation focused on the solo operator's work.

That model keeps solo operation simple and team operation centralized
without turning every run into a shared global credential.

## Repository Automation

Repository settings control trigger label, polling, default branch,
provider override, prepare behavior, PR cost footer, auto-merge settings,
and approval behavior. The repository issues panel can list GitHub issues
and delegate work by adding the trigger label through the same credential
path Syrus uses for polling.

paths, use [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting).
