# REST API

Syrus exposes an admin REST API for external operators and orchestrators.
Authenticate with an admin user's API token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYRUS_API_TOKEN" \
  https://syrus.example.com/api/v1/admin/overview
```

Non-admin tokens are rejected with `403 Forbidden`; missing or invalid
tokens return a JSON `401` error.

## Command Line Client

The repository includes a standalone Go CLI scaffold under `cli/`. It is
separate from the Rails app and builds to a single `syrus` binary:

```bash
cd cli
make build
```

Run `syrus configure` once to write `~/.syrus/credentials`:

```text
url=https://syrus.example.com
token=your-api-token
```

The CLI sends the same bearer token header as the REST examples:
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`. If credentials are missing or incomplete,
it prints `Run 'syrus configure' to set up your Syrus instance URL and API token.`

## Create a Direct Job

`POST /api/v1/admin/jobs` creates a direct Job and starts the normal
initial workflow when the Job is not blocked by dependencies or an Epic.
The Job belongs to the owner of the target repository, so the repository
owner's GitHub and agent credentials are used.

```bash
curl -X POST https://syrus.example.com/api/v1/admin/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYRUS_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "job": {
      "repository": "acme/widgets",
      "title": "Update the README",
      "prompt": "Add API setup instructions to the README.",
      "priority": "high",
      "agent_provider": "codex"
    }
  }'
```

Use either `repository_id` or `repository`/`repo` as `owner/name`.
Optional fields are `priority` (`high`, `medium`, `low`), `agent_provider`,
`epic_id`, and `owner_user_id`.

## Create an Epic

`POST /api/v1/admin/epics` creates an Epic in a repository owned by the
repository's Syrus user.

```bash
curl -X POST https://syrus.example.com/api/v1/admin/epics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYRUS_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "epic": {
      "repository": "acme/widgets",
      "title": "Documentation cleanup",
      "description": "Group the docs polish work.",
      "auto_approve_mode": "never"
    }
  }'
```

Optional fields are `github_issue_url`, `owner_user_id`, and
`auto_approve_mode`.
