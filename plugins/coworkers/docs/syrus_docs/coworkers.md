# Coworkers

Coworkers is an experimental, instance-local capability for persistent named
agents. It is disabled by default and requires beta mode before an administrator
can enable it.

The initial foundation stores user-owned coworker identities, globally unique
handles, model preferences, workspace remotes, appearance, explicit capability
grants, and main or side chat links. Existing chats remain Syrus chats unless a
coworker chat link explicitly assigns them to a coworker.

Coworker creation validates and tests the GitHub remote before creating any
records. It registers a previously unknown remote with polling and PR
automations disabled, then seeds an isolated `coworkers/<handle>` home branch.
Existing repository registrations are reused without changing their settings.
The remote's default branch is never modified.
